        <p class="text-justify text-white mb-8">Order Of Minerva band was born during the dark lockdown era with the purpose to bring a new light of hope for Melodic Metal. It's featured by a charming but aggressive front woman and a team of skilled musicians devoted to power progressive metal but influenced by many other genres.<br>
          The entire project is a concept based on all the modern society contraddictions: loneliness of human kind caused by social networks and other isolating tools, earth resources exploitation, the lack of goals for young generations and to do this the project sets all the events narrated in the songs in a not-too-far future where water has become the most valuable and expensive thing for human kind. <br>Cities are small strongholds in endless sandy deserts where big corporations manage everything with violence, indifference and injustice and poor people try to survive. "Order of Minerva" is a secret group of insurrectionary anarchists which aims to equally share the resources to everyone but violence brings violence.</p>
        <p class="text-justify text-white">Order of Minerva are currently about to release an EP composed by 4 songs recorded at Artesonika Recording Studios ( Vivaldi Metal Project etc ) and mastered by Staffan Karlsson ( Arch Enemy, Firewind, Nightrage ). Here is possible to listen as special preview to all the EP.</p>
